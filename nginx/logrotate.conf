# Place this file on the host server at: /etc/logrotate.d/gams-nginx
# The nginx-logs Docker volume must be mounted at the path below,
# or adjust the path to match where the volume is mounted on the host.

# To find the volume mount path on the host:
#   docker volume inspect gams-project_nginx-logs
#
# Example: /var/lib/docker/volumes/gams-project_nginx-logs/_data/*.log
